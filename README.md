# Browser_Listener
I developed a script that turns any machine (e.g., VMs or servers) into a server-based browser. Clients can remotely open browser tabs on the server via their web interface. This setup isolates browser activity to the server, protecting clients from browser threats, data exfiltration, and vulnerabilities while ensuring privacy.
